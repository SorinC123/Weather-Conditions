# Weather Conditions and Climate Change with ClimateWins

## Project Summary
This project assesses the tools available to categorize and predict the weather in mainland Europe using data collected by the European Climate Assessment & Data Set project. The study aims to explore the prediction accuracy of different
algorithms: K-nearest neighbors, Decision Tree, and Artificial Neural Networks. Gradient Descent algorithm was used for optimization.

## Key Questions
- Can machine learning algorithms effectively predict future weather conditions?

- What are the influential factors affecting happiness - economic, social, psychological, or environmental?

- Which countries rank highest and lowest in performance?

## Data Overview
The datasets are sourced from Kaggle and contain data from the Gallup World Poll. The scores are based on answers to the main life evaluation question asked in the poll. This question, known as the Cantril ladder, asks respondents to think of a ladder with the best possible life for them being a 10 and the worst possible life being a 0 and to rate their own current lives on that scale. The scores are from nationally representative samples for the years 2015-2019 and use the Gallup weights to make the estimates representative.
