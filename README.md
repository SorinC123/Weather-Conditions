# Weather Conditions and Climate Change with ClimateWins

## Project Summary
This project assesses the tools available to categorize and predict the weather in mainland Europe using data collected by the European Climate Assessment & Data Set project. The study aims to explore the prediction accuracy of different
algorithms: K-nearest neighbors, Decision Tree, and Artificial Neural Networks. Gradient Descent algorithm was used for optimization.

## Key Questions
- Can machine learning algorithms effectively predict future weather conditions?

- Which machine learning algorithm can be considered the definitive best choice for weather prediction?

- Does prediction accuracy vary depending on the algorithm used and the geographic location?

## Data Overview
The data sets used for this project include:

- weather observations from 18 different weather stations across Europe.
  
- data ranging from 1960 to 2022.
  
- recordings for almost every day with values such as temperature, wind speed, snow, global radiation, and more.
